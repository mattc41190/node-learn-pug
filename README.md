# node-learn-pug

## What Is This?

*node-learn-pug* is a repo dedicated to providing real word examples of where best to use the different pug methods found [here](https://pugjs.org/api/reference.html).

## Why Make This?

Around the web I have found several resources on how the pug templating language works. This portion of the technology is well documented, however the actual methods that the library exposes are largely un-"tutorilaized". This makes a lot of sense as the largest use case I see for pug is the server side rendering of templates or in the form of the *pug-cli* helping to create static assets. That being said, I am interested in seeing all of the the things that pug can do. 

## How Do I Use This?

- `git clone <this-repo>`
- `npm install`
- `cd <lesson-of-interest>`
- `node run.js`
